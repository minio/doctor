Errno::ENAMETOOLONG (File name too long @ rb_sysopen - # Minio Java Library for Amazon S3 Compatible Cloud Storage [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Minio/minio?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The Minio Java Client SDK provides simple APIs to access any Amazon S3 compatible object storage server.

This quickstart guide will show you how to install the client SDK and execute an example java program. For a complete list of APIs and examples, please take a look at the [Java Client API Reference](http://docs.minio.io/docs/java-client-api-reference) documentation.

This document assumes that you have one of the following Java Environments setup in place.
* [OracleJDK 7.0](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) or[ OracleJDK 8.0](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) 
* [OpenJDK7.0](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) or [OpenJDK8.0](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) 

## Download from maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.minio</groupId>
    <artifactId>minio</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Download from gradle

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'io.minio:minio:2.0.0'
}
```

## Download from JAR

You can download the latest [JAR](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/minio/minio/2.0.0/) directly from maven.

## Quick Start Example - File Uploader
This example program connects to an object storage server, makes a bucket on the server and then uploads a file to the bucket.

You need three items in order to connect to an object storage server.

```java

MinioClient minioClient = new MinioClient("https://play.minio.io:9000", "Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F", "zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG");

```

| Params     | Desc |  
| :------- | :---- |  
| Endpoint | URL to object storage service. |  
| Access Key    | Access key is like user ID that uniquely identifies your account.   |   
| Secret Key     | Secret key is the password to your account.    |

We will use the Minio server running at [https://play.minio.io:9000](https://play.minio.io:9000) in this example. Feel free to use this service for testing and development. Access credentials shown in this example are open to the public.

#### FileUploader.java
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.InvalidKeyException;

import org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException;

import io.minio.MinioClient;
import io.minio.errors.MinioException;

public class FileUploader {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, IOException, InvalidKeyException, XmlPullParserException {
    try {
      // Create a minioClient with the Minio Server name, Port, Access key and Secret key.
      MinioClient minioClient = new MinioClient("https://play.minio.io:9000", "Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F", "zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG");

      // Check if the bucket already exists.
      boolean isExist = minioClient.bucketExists("asiatrip");
      if(isExist) {
        System.out.println("Bucket already exists.");
      } else {
        // Make a new bucket called asiatrip to hold a zip file of photos.
        minioClient.makeBucket("asiatrip");
      }

      // Upload the zip file to the bucket with putObject
      minioClient.putObject("asiatrip","asiaphotos.zip", "/tmp/asiaphotos.zip");
      System.out.println("/tmp/asiaphotos.zip is successfully uploaded as asiaphotos.zip in asiatrip bucket.");
    } catch(MinioException e) {
      System.out.println("Error occured: " + e);
    }
  }
}
 
```
#### Compile FileUploader
```bash
$ javac -cp "minio-2.0.0.jar"  FileUploader.java
```

#### Run FileUploader
```bash
$ java -cp "minio-2.0.0.jar" FileUploader.java
/tmp/asiaphotos.zip is successfully uploaded as asiaphotos.zip in asiatrip bucket.

$  mc ls play/asiatrip/

Errno::ENAMETOOLONG (File name too long @ rb_sysopen - # Minio Java Library for Amazon S3 Compatible Cloud Storage [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Minio/minio?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The Minio Java Client SDK provides simple APIs to access any Amazon S3 compatible object storage server.

This quickstart guide will show you how to install the client SDK and execute an example java program. For a complete list of APIs and examples, please take a look at the [Java Client API Reference](http://docs.minio.io/docs/java-client-api-reference) documentation.

This document assumes that you have one of the following Java Environments setup in place.
* [OracleJDK 7.0](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) or[ OracleJDK 8.0](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) 
* [OpenJDK7.0](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) or [OpenJDK8.0](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) 

## Download from maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.minio</groupId>
    <artifactId>minio</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Download from gradle

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'io.minio:minio:2.0.0'
}
```

## Download from JAR

You can download the latest [JAR](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/minio/minio/2.0.0/) directly from maven.

## Quick Start Example - File Uploader
This example program connects to an object storage server, makes a bucket on the server and then uploads a file to the bucket.

You need three items in order to connect to an object storage server.

```java

MinioClient minioClient = new MinioClient("https://play.minio.io:9000", "Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F", "zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG");

```

| Params     | Desc |  
| :------- | :---- |  
| Endpoint | URL to object storage service. |  
| Access Key    | Access key is like user ID that uniquely identifies your account.   |   
| Secret Key     | Secret key is the password to your account.    |

We will use the Minio server running at [https://play.minio.io:9000](https://play.minio.io:9000) in this example. Feel free to use this service for testing and development. Access credentials shown in this example are open to the public.

#### FileUploader.java
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.InvalidKeyException;

import org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException;

import io.minio.MinioClient;
import io.minio.errors.MinioException;

public class FileUploader {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, IOException, InvalidKeyException, XmlPullParserException {
    try {
      // Create a minioClient with the Minio Server name, Port, Access key and Secret key.
      MinioClient minioClient = new MinioClient("https://play.minio.io:9000", "Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F", "zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG");

      // Check if the bucket already exists.
      boolean isExist = minioClient.bucketExists("asiatrip");
      if(isExist) {
        System.out.println("Bucket already exists.");
      } else {
        // Make a new bucket called asiatrip to hold a zip file of photos.
        minioClient.makeBucket("asiatrip");
      }

      // Upload the zip file to the bucket with putObject
      minioClient.putObject("asiatrip","asiaphotos.zip", "/tmp/asiaphotos.zip");
      System.out.println("/tmp/asiaphotos.zip is successfully uploaded as asiaphotos.zip in asiatrip bucket.");
    } catch(MinioException e) {
      System.out.println("Error occured: " + e);
    }
  }
}
 
```
#### Compile FileUploader
```bash
$ javac -cp "minio-2.0.0.jar"  FileUploader.java
```

#### Run FileUploader
```bash
$ java -cp "minio-2.0.0.jar" FileUploader.java
/tmp/asiaphotos.zip is successfully uploaded as asiaphotos.zip in asiatrip bucket.

$  mc ls play/asiatrip/

## Download from maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.minio</groupId>
    <artifactId>minio</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Download from gradle

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'io.minio:minio:2.0.0'
}
```

## Download from JAR

You can download the latest [JAR](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/minio/minio/2.0.0/) directly from maven.

## Quick Start Example - File Uploader
This example program connects to an object storage server, makes a bucket on the server and then uploads a file to the bucket.

You need three items in order to connect to an object storage server.

```java

MinioClient minioClient = new MinioClient("https://play.minio.io:9000", "Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F", "zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG");

```

| Params     | Desc |  
| :------- | :---- |  
| Endpoint | URL to object storage service. |  
| Access Key    | Access key is like user ID that uniquely identifies your account.   |   
| Secret Key     | Secret key is the password to your account.    |

We will use the Minio server running at [https://play.minio.io:9000](https://play.minio.io:9000) in this example. Feel free to use this service for testing and development. Access credentials shown in this example are open to the public.

#### FileUploader.java
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.InvalidKeyException;

import org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException;

import io.minio.MinioClient;
import io.minio.errors.MinioException;

public class FileUploader {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, IOException, InvalidKeyException, XmlPullParserException {
    try {
      // Create a minioClient with the Minio Server name, Port, Access key and Secret key.
      MinioClient minioClient = new MinioClient("https://play.minio.io:9000", "Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F", "zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG");

      // Check if the bucket already exists.
      boolean isExist = minioClient.bucketExists("asiatrip");
      if(isExist) {
        System.out.println("Bucket already exists.");
      } else {
        // Make a new bucket called asiatrip to hold a zip file of photos.
        minioClient.makeBucket("asiatrip");
      }

      // Upload the zip file to the bucket with putObject
      minioClient.putObject("asiatrip","asiaphotos.zip", "/tmp/asiaphotos.zip");
      System.out.println("/tmp/asiaphotos.zip is successfully uploaded as asiaphotos.zip in asiatrip bucket.");
    } catch(MinioException e) {
      System.out.println("Error occured: " + e);
    }
  }
}
 
```
#### Compile FileUploader
```bash
$ javac -cp "minio-2.0.0.jar"  FileUploader.java
```

#### Run FileUploader
```bash
$ java -cp "minio-2.0.0.jar" FileUploader.java
/tmp/asiaphotos.zip is successfully uploaded as asiaphotos.zip in asiatrip bucket.

$  mc ls play/asiatrip/
[2016-06-02 18:10:29 PDT]  82KiB asiaphotos.zip
```

## Download from gradle

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'io.minio:minio:2.0.0'
}
```

## Download from JAR

You can download the latest [JAR](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/minio/minio/2.0.0/) directly from maven.

## Quick Start Example - File Uploader
This example program connects to an object storage server, makes a bucket on the server and then uploads a file to the bucket.

You need three items in order to connect to an object storage server.

```java

MinioClient minioClient = new MinioClient("https://play.minio.io:9000", "Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F", "zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG");

```

| Params     | Desc |  
| :------- | :---- |  
| Endpoint | URL to object storage service. |  
| Access Key    | Access key is like user ID that uniquely identifies your account.   |   
| Secret Key     | Secret key is the password to your account.    |

We will use the Minio server running at [https://play.minio.io:9000](https://play.minio.io:9000) in this example. Feel free to use this service for testing and development. Access credentials shown in this example are open to the public.

#### FileUploader.java

public class FileUploader {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, IOException, InvalidKeyException, XmlPullParserException {
    try {
      // Create a minioClient with the Minio Server name, Port, Access key and Secret key.
      MinioClient minioClient = new MinioClient("https://play.minio.io:9000", "Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F", "zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG");

      // Check if the bucket already exists.
      boolean isExist = minioClient.bucketExists("asiatrip");
      if(isExist) {
        System.out.println("Bucket already exists.");
      } else {
        // Make a new bucket called asiatrip to hold a zip file of photos.
        minioClient.makeBucket("asiatrip");
      }

      // Upload the zip file to the bucket with putObject
      minioClient.putObject("asiatrip","asiaphotos.zip", "/tmp/asiaphotos.zip");
      System.out.println("/tmp/asiaphotos.zip is successfully uploaded as asiaphotos.zip in asiatrip bucket.");
    } catch(MinioException e) {
      System.out.println("Error occured: " + e);
    }
  }
}
 
```
#### Compile FileUploader
```bash
$ javac -cp "minio-2.0.0.jar"  FileUploader.java
```

#### Run FileUploader
```bash
$ java -cp "minio-2.0.0.jar" FileUploader.java
/tmp/asiaphotos.zip is successfully uploaded as asiaphotos.zip in asiatrip bucket.

$  mc ls play/asiatrip/

Errno::ENAMETOOLONG (File name too long @ rb_sysopen - # Minio Java Library for Amazon S3 Compatible Cloud Storage [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Minio/minio?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The Minio Java Client SDK provides simple APIs to access any Amazon S3 compatible object storage server.

This quickstart guide will show you how to install the client SDK and execute an example java program. For a complete list of APIs and examples, please take a look at the [Java Client API Reference](http://docs.minio.io/docs/java-client-api-reference) documentation.

This document assumes that you have one of the following Java Environments setup in place.
* [OracleJDK 7.0](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) or[ OracleJDK 8.0](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) 
* [OpenJDK7.0](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) or [OpenJDK8.0](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) 

## Download from maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.minio</groupId>
    <artifactId>minio</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Download from gradle

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'io.minio:minio:2.0.0'
}
```

## Download from JAR

You can download the latest [JAR](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/minio/minio/2.0.0/) directly from maven.

## Quick Start Example - File Uploader
This example program connects to an object storage server, makes a bucket on the server and then uploads a file to the bucket.

You need three items in order to connect to an object storage server.

```java

MinioClient minioClient = new MinioClient("https://play.minio.io:9000", "Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F", "zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG");

```

| Params     | Desc |  
| :------- | :---- |  
| Endpoint | URL to object storage service. |  
| Access Key    | Access key is like user ID that uniquely identifies your account.   |   
| Secret Key     | Secret key is the password to your account.    |

We will use the Minio server running at [https://play.minio.io:9000](https://play.minio.io:9000) in this example. Feel free to use this service for testing and development. Access credentials shown in this example are open to the public.

#### FileUploader.java
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.InvalidKeyException;

import org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException;

import io.minio.MinioClient;
import io.minio.errors.MinioException;

public class FileUploader {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, IOException, InvalidKeyException, XmlPullParserException {
    try {
      // Create a minioClient with the Minio Server name, Port, Access key and Secret key.
      MinioClient minioClient = new MinioClient("https://play.minio.io:9000", "Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F", "zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG");

      // Check if the bucket already exists.
      boolean isExist = minioClient.bucketExists("asiatrip");
      if(isExist) {
        System.out.println("Bucket already exists.");
      } else {
        // Make a new bucket called asiatrip to hold a zip file of photos.
        minioClient.makeBucket("asiatrip");
      }

      // Upload the zip file to the bucket with putObject
      minioClient.putObject("asiatrip","asiaphotos.zip", "/tmp/asiaphotos.zip");
      System.out.println("/tmp/asiaphotos.zip is successfully uploaded as asiaphotos.zip in asiatrip bucket.");
    } catch(MinioException e) {
      System.out.println("Error occured: " + e);
    }
  }
}
 
```
#### Compile FileUploader
```bash
$ javac -cp "minio-2.0.0.jar"  FileUploader.java
```

#### Run FileUploader
```bash
$ java -cp "minio-2.0.0.jar" FileUploader.java
/tmp/asiaphotos.zip is successfully uploaded as asiaphotos.zip in asiatrip bucket.

$  mc ls play/asiatrip/
[2016-06-02 18:10:29 PDT]  82KiB asiaphotos.zip
```
